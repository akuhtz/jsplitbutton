# jsplitbutton
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/jsplitbutton

A simple implementation of the split button control in Java. This control raises two events.

    buttonClicked(e)
    splitButtonClicked(e) 

The buttonClicked event is raised when the button is clicked, the left part, which will not trigger the dropdown menu. Whereas the splitButtonClicked event is raised when the split part of the button is clicked and displays a popup menu.

To handle these events you need to subscribe to SplitButtonActionListener.
